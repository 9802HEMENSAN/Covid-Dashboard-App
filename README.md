# Covid-Dashboard-App

Creating an entire application with all the specified features would require a substantial amount of code and configuration. However, I can provide you with a step-by-step guide to help you set up the project and implement the key features. Here's how you can get started:

**Step 1: Set Up the Project**

1. Create a new React app with TypeScript using Create React App:
   
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app contact-management-app --template typescript
   cd contact-management-app
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install react-query react-router-dom @reduxjs/toolkit axios leaflet react-chartjs-2 tailwindcss
   ```

**Step 2: API Calls and Data Management**

1. Set up React Query to handle API calls and data management. You can create a `src/api` folder and define your API calls using Axios.

2. Fetch contact data and manage it using Redux. You can create a `src/features/contacts` folder and set up Redux slices for adding, editing, and deleting contacts.

**Step 3: Contact Management**

1. Create components for adding, editing, and deleting contacts. You can place these components in a `src/components/contacts` folder.

2. Create a ContactList component that displays the list of contacts with buttons to view, edit, and delete.

3. Implement React Router v6 to navigate between different pages and components.

**Step 4: Charts and Maps**

1. Fetch COVID-19 data using React Query. Create components to display the line graph and the map with markers.

2. Use `react-chartjs-2` to create a line graph that shows case fluctuations over time.

3. Use `react-leaflet` to create a map with markers indicating COVID-19 data for different countries.

**Step 5: Styling with Tailwind CSS**

1. Configure Tailwind CSS by following its documentation.

2. Apply Tailwind CSS classes to your components for styling.

**Step 6: Deployment**

1. Set up a GitHub/GitLab repository for your project.

2. Deploy your app using a service like Vercel, GitHub Pages, or Heroku. Refer to the respective documentation for deployment steps.

**Step 7: Documentation**

1. Create a README.md file in your repository with instructions on how to run the app, details about the API endpoints used, and any other relevant information.

Remember, this is a high-level overview, and each step involves writing code, creating components, and configuring various settings. The implementation details can be quite extensive. You can find many tutorials and resources online for each of these individual steps. Make sure to thoroughly test your app and ensure it meets the specified requirements before deploying it.

As for the GitHub/GitLab repository and deployment, it's recommended to follow the documentation of the chosen deployment platform for detailed steps.

Keep in mind that software development is an iterative process, so don't hesitate to make adjustments and improvements as you go along. Good luck with your project!
